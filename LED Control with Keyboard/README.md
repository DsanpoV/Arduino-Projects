# First Arduino Project: LED Control with Keypad

This is my first Arduino project. It demonstrates controlling an **RGB LED strip** using a **4x4 keypad**. Each key corresponds to a different color, and pressing it updates the LEDs in real time.

## Overview

The project uses an **8-LED NeoPixel strip** connected to pin 6 of the Arduino. A **4x4 keypad** is used to select different colors. When a key is pressed, all LEDs in the strip light up with the corresponding color.  

This simple project helped me understand the basics of **LED control, NeoPixel library usage, and keypad input handling**.

## Components Used

- Arduino R4 Uno 
- 8-LED RGB NeoPixel strip  
- 4x4 Keypad  
- Jumper wires and breadboard for connections

## Notes

- This was my first Arduino project, so it focuses on **basic input and output control**.  
- The project can be extended with additional colors, animations, or LED effects.
